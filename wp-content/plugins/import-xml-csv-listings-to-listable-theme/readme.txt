Easily import job listings from any XML or CSV file to the Listable theme with the WP Job Manager Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Listable Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your listings to the Listable theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a job from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Listable Add-On fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a listing in Listable.

= Why you should use the Listable Add-On for WP All Import =

* Instead of using the Custom Fields section of WP All Import, you are shown the fields like Listing Expiry Date, Company Name, etc. in plain English.

* Automatically find the job location just like manually adding a job.

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements that the data in your file be organized in a certain way. CSV imports into Listable is easy, no matter the structure of your file.

* Supports files of practically unlimited size by automatically splitting them into chunks. WP All Import is limited solely by your server settings.
