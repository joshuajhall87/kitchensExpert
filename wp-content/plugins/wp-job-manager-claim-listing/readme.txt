Let users claim listings on your website! Once a listing is claimed a "Verified" badge will be displayed.

By default claiming a listing is free, and site owners can choose to approve or deny a claim. If using WP Job Manager - WooCommerce Paid Listings site owners have the ability to charge for a listing to be claimed, and assign the relevant package attributes to the listing once approved.
